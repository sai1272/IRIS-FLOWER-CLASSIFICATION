# IRIS-FLOWER-CLASSIFICATION

### Dataset
The dataset is a well-known dataset in machine learning called the "Iris dataset," which is available from various sources, including [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html). The dataset contains 150 samples, with 50 samples from each of the three species.

### Problem Description
The goal is to build a machine learning model that can predict the species of an iris flower based on the four features provided. The species of the iris flowers are as follows:
- Setosa
- Versicolor
- Virginica

### Steps Involved
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean the dataset (if necessary).
2. **Data Splitting**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. **Feature Scaling**: Standardize the features to improve model performance.
4. **Model Training**: Train a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest Classifier) on the training data.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model on the testing data using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

### Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn`
